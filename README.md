technical_support_tests
=======================
This repository is used to test the coding skills of our potential technical support engineers :-)

The directory structure is as follows:

-models // contains the implementations that need to be created by you

-spec   // contains the tests that need to be run

Create a fork
You can create a fork with technical_support_tests_YOUR_NAME
From then on you can work on your fork and commit to it.

Here's your exercise.
Please create an implementation for the following tests so that all tests are green (passing).
You can also have a look at the test files :)

First, install bundler and all required gems:
# bundle install

You can start the tests by running the following command:
# bundle exec rspec spec
